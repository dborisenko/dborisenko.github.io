By this post I would like to start series of articles about designing and implementing microservices on top of Akka Cluster. All the following is my personal thought, based on my experience. These records are attempt to systematize my knowledge and experience on a specific domain. Iâ€™m writing them mostly for myself to keep something in mind and avoid some issues in a future.

* Part 1. [Decomposition of monolithic application to Akka Cluster microservices](2016-01-31-decomposition-of-monolithic-application-to-akka-cluster-microservices).
* Part 2. [Microservice Topologies in Akka Cluster](2016-02-02-microservice-topologies-in-akka-cluster).
* Part 3. [Static Microservice Discovery](2016-02-07-static-microservice-discovery).
* Part 4. Service Registry
* Part 5. Dinamic Microservice Discovery.
